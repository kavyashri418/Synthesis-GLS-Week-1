# Open-Source Simulator Verilog

## 1. Introduction to Open-Source Simulator Verilog

### 1.1 Introduction to Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Design and Testbench

**Simulator** - RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simulating the design. Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design.  
- *iverilog* is the tool used in this course.

**Design** - Design is the actual Verilog code or set of Verilog codes which has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications.

**Testbench** - Testbench is the setup to apply stimulus (test_vector) to the design to check its functionality.

**How simulator works?**  
- Simulator looks for changes on the input signals.  
- Upon change to the input, the output is evaluated.  
- If no changes to the input, no change to the output!  
- Simulator is looking for changes in the values of input.

**Note:**  
- Design may have one or more primary inputs, one or more primary outputs.  
- Testbench doesnâ€™t have a primary input or primary outputs.

**Iverilog based simulation flow**  

*(You can add your simulation flow diagram or steps here)*

### 1.2 Introduction to Yosys

**Synthesizer** - Tool used for converting the RTL to netlist.  
- *Yosys* is the synthesizer used in this course.

**Verify the synthesis**  

**Note:**  
- The set of primary inputs / primary outputs will remain same between the RTL design and synthesized netlist.  
- The same testbench can be used!
