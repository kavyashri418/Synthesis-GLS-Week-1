# 1 Timing libs, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding types

## 1.1 Introduction to timing.libs

A timing library (usually with extension .lib, often called a Liberty file) is a standard cell characterization file used in digital design.
It describes the electrical, functional, and timing behavior of each cell in a given standard cell library under specific process-voltage-temperature (PVT) conditions.

sudo apt install neovim -qt
```

Step 2: Open sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib

```bash
gvim sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```
## 1.2 Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis

HIERARCHICAL SYNTHESIS: in hierarchical synthesis, the RTL design is synthesized block by block (module by module) instead of flattening everything into a single netlist.Each block is optimized independently, and then the blocks are connected together at the top level.

Advantages
- Large designs are easier to manage in smaller pieces.
- Already-synthesized blocks can be reused in multiple projects.

Disadvantages
- Since blocks are optimized individually, cross-boundary optimizations (sharing logic, retiming, etc.) are limited.
- Block-to-block connections may cause extra buffers and delay.

FLAT SYNTHESIS: in flat synthesis, the entire RTL design hierarchy is flattened into one big netlist before synthesis.The synthesis tool sees the whole design as a single module and optimizes globally.

Advanatages
- Global optimization gives potentially better timing, area, and power.
- Logic sharing, retiming, restructuring across module boundaries is possible.

Disadvantages
- Large designs take much longer and require more compute resources.
- Debugging and floorplanning are harder.

## 1.3 Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization

WHY FLOP?
A flip-flop (DFF, register) is a sequential element that stores data on a clock edge.In RTL coding, synthesis tools infer flops from always blocks with clock sensitivity.

- Asynchronous Reset: the Reset (or Clear) signal forces the flip-flop output Q = 0 immediately, regardless of the clock.
  Asynchronous Reset D Flip Flop

```bash
module dff_asyncres (input clk, input async_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_reset)
    if (async_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```

- Asynchronous Set: the Set signal forces the flip-flop output Q = 1 immediately, regardless of the clock. It is typically active-high (or active-low depending on library).
  Asynchronous Set D Flip Flop

 ```bash
module dff_async_set (input clk, input async_set, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk, posedge async_set)
    if (async_set)
      q <= 1'b1;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```

- Synchronous ReSet: the flip-flop output Q = 0, but only on the active clock edge. The reset signal is sampled at the clock edge â€” if asserted, the flop outputs 0 at that edge
 Synchronous Set D Flip Flop

 ```bash
module dff_syncres (input clk, input async_reset, input sync_reset, input d, output reg q);
  always @ (posedge clk)
    if (sync_reset)
      q <= 1'b0;
    else
      q <= d;
endmodule
```
