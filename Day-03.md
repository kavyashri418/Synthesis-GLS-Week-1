## Combinational and Sequential Optimizations

### Introduction to Optimization

#### Combinational Logic Optimization
- Squeezing the logic to get the most optimized design  
- Area and power savings  

**Techniques:**  
- **Constant Propagation** â€“ Direct optimization  
- **Boolean Logic Optimization**

#### Sequential Logic Optimization

**Basic**  
- Sequential Constant Propagation  

**Advanced**  
- State Optimization  
- Retiming  
- Sequential Logic Cloning (Floor plan aware synthesis)
