# Synthesis and GLS

### Welcome to the 5-Day RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop. This repository explores the fundamentals and advanced concepts of digital design, synthesis, and gate-level simulation (GLS). Across five days, we will learn to write efficient, synthesizable Verilog, simulate designs, optimize for area, power, and timing, and handle synthesis-simulation mismatches. 


## Day 1 – Introduction to Icarus Verilog (iverilog), Design and Testbench

Learned to use **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** for writing design modules and testbenches, simulating and verifying their functionality.

**Focus:**
- Verilog module design
- Testbench creation and waveform analysis
- Simulation workflow and debugging

---

## Day 2 – Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis, Efficient Flop Coding Types

Explored **timing libraries**, different synthesis approaches, and **efficient flip-flop coding** to improve area, timing, and power.

**Focus:**
- Hierarchical vs flat synthesis
- Flop coding styles (synchronous/asynchronous reset, set, enable)
- Using timing libraries in design

---

## Day 3 – Combinational and Sequential Optimizations

Optimized designs at **combinational and sequential levels** for area, power, and timing improvements.

**Focus:**
- Constant propagation and Boolean simplification
- State minimization, retiming, and cloning
- Balancing performance with resource usage

---

## Day 4 – GLS, Blocking vs Non-Blocking, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatches

Studied **gate-level simulation (GLS)**, blocking vs non-blocking assignments, and common mismatches between synthesis and simulation.

**Focus:**
- Gate-level simulation of synthesized designs
- Understanding `=` (blocking) vs `<=` (non-blocking)
- Detecting and resolving synthesis-simulation mismatches

---

## Day 5 – Optimization in Synthesis

Advanced optimization techniques to improve **performance, area, and power** in synthesized designs.

**Focus:**
- Combinational and sequential logic optimizations
- Writing efficient, synthesizable Verilog
- Trade-offs in synthesis for high-performance designs
